### The Fall of Feydor and The Flight of **Yaereene** (formerly seperate story known as "Feydorian Manuscript")

Before Yaereene ended up at College of the Unheard, she lived in the D&D world of Feydorian Feyrun. For the first fourteen years of her life, she lived in the Malynor castle with her parents, the King and Queen of Feydor Forest. She lived a good life, and prospered as a princess would. She wasn't aware that her father— or at least the man she _thought_ was her father— had lost his ranking among kings.

He had been slowly undermined by an evil man whose name had been lost to time, simply known to the Feydorians as the _Lich of Feydor_. After a year or so of growing dissent, the Lich had rotted the King's reign, and was able to use his influence to pull a coup on the King. The evil man had control now of the whole of the island nation, and by his under-handed actions before his move on the Castle, the King had the forethought to warn his teen daughter and his wife to escape the Castle Town. Before they could do so, though, they were attacked by dissenters who followed the Lich, and wanted the whole royal family dead. They barely escaped with their lives, the Queen very much injured.
