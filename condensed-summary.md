### The Fall of Feydor and The Flight of Yaereene (formerly separate story known as "Feydorian Manuscript")

Before **Yaereene** ended up at College of the Unheard, she lived in the D&D world of Feydorian Feyrun. For the first fourteen years of her life, she lived in the Malynor castle with her parents, the King and Queen of Feydor Forest. She lived a good life, and prospered as a princess would. She wasn't aware that her father— or at least the man she _thought_ was her father— had lost his ranking among kings.

Her mother, in addition to the Queen, was part of what at that time had been a small subset of Feydorians with the power of foresight. She had been sitting in front of the Tree of Life— one that the Feydorians had ascribed this power to. Suddenly, Danche in his most favored form, that of a stag, appeared to the faithful half-elf and explained that she was to carry a child destined for more, and the very next day, without a trace of bearing said child, gave birth to Yaereene, the demigoddess, half-elf.

Her mother laid to rest, she then was faced with a difficult decision, one which would shape the rest of her life— stay, and lose her life grieving, or go, and face new worlds? She bravely chose the latter and ran, finding
